# Australia Geospatial Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive geospatial analysis of various datasets related to Australia. The analysis includes visualization and examination of mines, ports, land boundaries, population density, temperature, vegetation, and emissions data.

## Datasets

The following datasets are used in this project:

1. **Mines**: POINT data on the locations of mines in Australia.
2. **Ports**: POINT data on the locations of ports in Australia.
3. **Land Boundary**: POLYGON data of states in Australia.
4. **Population**: POLYGON data with city areas and population density data.
5. **Temperature**: POINT data with air temperatures in various cities.
6. **Vegetation**: RASTER data with tree cover height.
7. **Emissions**: POINT data on emissions of mines.

## Project Structure

- `Australia-Geospatial-Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, processing, visualization, and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and setup instructions for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install rasterio rasterstats numpy mapclassify geopandas networkx pandas matplotlib shapely scipy folium seaborn
    ```

2. **Load the Jupyter Notebook**:
    Open `Australia-Geospatial-Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
    Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Analysis Sections

1. **Install Libraries**: Install necessary Python libraries.
2. **Import Libraries**: Import the required libraries for geospatial analysis.
3. **Load Datasets**: Load datasets from Google Drive.
4. **Commodity Transportation Network Visualization**: Create and visualize a network of mines and ports based on commodity transportation.
5. **Commodity-wise Analysis**: Visualize mines and ports based on specific commodities.
6. **Vegetation and Population**: Analyze the relationship between vegetation and population density.
7. **Emission Data Analysis**: Analyze emissions data from mines and their impact on vegetation and population.
8. **Weather and Population Combined**: Analyze weather station data in relation to mines, ports, and population.

## Results

The project provides various visualizations and analyses, including:

- Maps showing the locations of mines, ports, and weather stations.
- Network graphs of commodity transportation.
- Analysis of the relationship between emissions and vegetation, population, and ports.
- Visualization of population density and vegetation cover.

## Conclusion

This project offers a detailed geospatial analysis of multiple datasets related to Australia, providing insights into the spatial distribution and relationships between different geographical and environmental factors.
